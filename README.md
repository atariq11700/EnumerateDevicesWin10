# Enumerate Connected Devices

This is a simple Visual Studio sln that uses windows api calls in order to enumerate and print connected device's names. This shows the same names and devices that you would find in device manager, just in a console window. I had this windows issue where after booting my pc, the `device disconnected` sound would play 5 minutes later, on every boot. I made this so I could print and copy the names of the connected devices before and after the sound, allowing me to find which device was causing the issue.
